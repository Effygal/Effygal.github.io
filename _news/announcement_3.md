[New England Systems Day 2025](https://khoury-srg.github.io/nesd25/) is now open for registration! 
Last year I gave a talk on workload characterization with stochastic processes and Markov models. This year Iâ€™m excited to build on that with new insights into high-fidelity trace synthesis for storage benchmarking. Hope to see you there!
