## Abstract
The LSM-tree is not inherently optimized for efficient reads or space utilization. This project presents a proof of concept for an ISC-enabled LSM-tree, aiming to enhance read performance and space efficiency by offloading parallel search computations from the host to storage devices.
We provide emulations built on a skiplist-based LSM tree.
