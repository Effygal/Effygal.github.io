## Abstract
Performance isolation remains challenging in multi-tenant cloud storage. In private clouds like VMware vSAN, virtual disks striped over shared devices cause congestion, especially during bursts.

We propose a lightweight, non-intrusive resource allocation mechanism that eliminates reliance on single bottleneck controllers or specialized device features.

Our design schedules per-VM I/Os using hypervisor throttling, preserving FCFS servicing at devices. A unified linear programming formula runs in a feedback loop to solve optimal IOPS rates per virtual disk, maximizing throughput under QoS and device capacity constraints.

Simulations show effective I/O throttling, burst traffic isolation at the source, reduced destination congestion, and significantly lower end-to-end latency.
