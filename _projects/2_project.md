## Abstract
We present 2DIO, a trace generator creating cache-accurate
        stressful I/O workloads. While existing tools are limited to
        generating traces with well-behaved, concave hit ratio curves,
        2DIO produces ones with tunable complex cache behaviors,
        particularly performance cliffs and plateaus.
        
        Our framework encodes a workload as a compact parameter triplet, capturing both short-term recency and long-term frequency. This parsimonious parameterization allows researchers to easily translate individual adjustments into predictable cache effects across various eviction policies. It enables the parameter space to be "swept" for exhaustive exploration of desired cache behavior, or to mimic real traces by calibrating parameters to match observed behaviors. Once tuned, the triplet allows traces to be replayed at different
        scales, adapting to various systems under evaluation while
        preserving cache behaviors. The benefits of 2DIO extend
        beyond cache accuracy, enabling portable, cross-platform
        benchmarking, protecting proprietary information, and facilitating secure knowledge sharing across organizations.
        
        Evaluations demonstrate 2DIOâ€™s ability to customize traces
        with a continuum of "what-if" cache behaviors and to repro-
        duce real-world ones with high accuracy.
