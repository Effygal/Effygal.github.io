- title: Programming Experience
  contents:
    My university coursework required using C/C++ or formal specification languages (e.g., NuSMV). 
    I used either Python or Mathematica for analytical modeling, preferring the former.  
    For most of the MOC- and VMware-affiliated projects, interfacing Python with modern C++ FFIs (e.g. pybind11) has been my primary development workflow. Occasionally I write low-level instrumentation tools (e.g., Pintools) for performance analysis.
