Hello! I'm a third-year Computer Science PhD student specializing in large-scale distributed storage, caching algorithms, and tiered-memory/CXL-enabled systems. My current focus involves mathematical modeling and simulations for computer system performance.

Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YirongWn) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yirong-effy-w-1b2a12122/) for more updates and professional networking.
