I'm a fourth-year Computer Science PhD student specializing in analytical modeling and simulation of computer systems. My work includes cache analysis, workload characterization and high-fidelity workload synthesis. 

I am currently working with [Prof. Peter Desnoyers](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pjd/) in the [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu/).
