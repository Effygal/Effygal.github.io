I specialize in performance modeling and simulation of computer systems. My work includes cache/QoS modeling, workload characterization, and high-fidelity trace synthesis for system benchmarking.

I am currently working with [Prof. Peter Desnoyers](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pjd/) in the [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu/).
