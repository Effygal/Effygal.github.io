Hello! I'm a fourth-year Computer Science PhD student specializing in analytical modeling of computer systems. My current research focuses on cache performance analysis, high-fidelity synthesis for storage benchmarking, and QoS modeling for distributed storage systems.

Feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YirongWn) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yirong-effy-w-1b2a12122/) for more updates and professional networking.
