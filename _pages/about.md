Hello! I'm a fourth-year Computer Science PhD student specializing in analytical modeling of computer systems. My research focuses on cache modeling and cache-accurate workload synthesis for storage system benchmarking. I am overall interested in performance modeling, simulation, and optimization of computer systems. I am currently working with [Prof. Peter Desnoyers](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pjd/) in the [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YirongWn) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yirong-effy-w-1b2a12122/) for more updates and professional networking.
