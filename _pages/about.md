Fourth-year Computer Science PhD candidate specializing in analytical modeling of computer systems. I focus on cache modeling and cache-accurate workload synthesis for storage benchmarking, with broader interests in performance modeling, simulation and system optimization. I am currently working with [Prof. Peter Desnoyers](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pjd/) in the [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu/).
