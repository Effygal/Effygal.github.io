<a href="https://khoury-srg.github.io/Northeastern-Systems-Day-2024/">Northeastern Systems Day 2024</a>  is now open for registration! I'll be attending and give a speech on reuse distance-based cache modeling matrics.

***
I gave a speech on the same topic for the last-years' event. Let me know if you are interested in more details.
